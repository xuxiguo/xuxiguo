Grounded in cutting-edge technology and financial theory, my research agenda spans three core areas: **FinTech**, **Machine Learning**, and **Investment Management**. I develop explainable AI models to uncover hidden patterns in mutual funds, hedge funds, and financial analyst behavior. My work bridges the gap between traditional finance and modern machine learning, with a particular focus on how artificial intelligence can enhance investment decision-making and risk management.

As an educator, I teach blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and finance to both undergraduate and graduate students. I'm passionate about making complex financial concepts accessible through hands-on learning experiences. Beyond the classroom, I actively research the intersection of AI and finance, exploring how machine learning can decode the complexities of financial markets.

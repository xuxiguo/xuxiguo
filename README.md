Grounded in cutting-edge technology and financial theory, my research agenda spans three core areas: **FinTech**, **Machine Learning**, and **Investment Management**. I develop explainable AI models to uncover hidden patterns in mutual funds, hedge funds, and financial analyst behavior. My work bridges the gap between traditional finance and modern machine learning, with a particular focus on how artificial intelligence can enhance investment decision-making and risk management.

As an educator, I teach blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and finance to both undergraduate and graduate students. I'm passionate about making complex financial concepts accessible through hands-on learning experiences. Beyond the classroom, I actively research the intersection of AI and finance, exploring how machine learning can decode the complexities of financial markets.

## 🎓 Teaching Innovation

### Customized GPT for Teaching
A comprehensive collection of educational GPT configurations designed to enhance student learning through Socratic questioning and guided critical thinking. This project showcases specialized GPTs for finance, blockchain, and business education that guide students through complex concepts using structured questioning rather than providing direct answers.

**Key Features:**
- **Design Framework**: Automated prompt builder GPT for instructors
- **Live Demo Collection**: Working educational agents across multiple disciplines
- **Three-Stage Workflow**: DESIGN → IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE cycle
- **Real-world Application**: Bitcoin ETF analysis, Monster Beverage capital budgeting, and blockchain case studies

### CognitoAI: Educational GPT Evaluation
Advanced evaluation platform that completes the educational AI cycle by providing automated assessment of GPT conversations. The system features a 6-dimension evaluation matrix including critical thinking, content understanding, communication skills, problem-solving, engagement level, and knowledge application.

**Platform Capabilities:**
- **Anti-Cheating Detection**: Real-time monitoring for paste detection and AI-generated content
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant performance insights for students
- **Instructor Analytics**: Detailed class performance and individual progress tracking
- **Automated Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple learning dimensions

## 🤖 AI-Powered Research Workflow

I have developed a two-stage multi-agent orchestration system for academic finance research, built on GitHub Copilot's agent framework. These tools automate the full research pipeline — from raw data extraction through to publication-ready results — using specialized AI agents that collaborate through a conductor-delegate pattern.

### Research Data Orchestra
Handles the **upstream data pipeline**: planning, source discovery, extraction, processing, validation, and documentation. The system uses a 3-tier document architecture to minimize context overhead while enabling parallel agent execution.

**Agent Roster:**
- `@Strategist` — Designs data extraction plans and researches source feasibility
- `@Conductor` — Orchestrates the full pipeline and delegates to subagents
- **Subagents**: Scout (source discovery) · Analyst (deep research) · Miner (extraction code) · Refiner (data cleaning/merging) · Sentinel (validation) · Scribe (documentation)

**Key Innovations:**
- **Context efficiency**: Backbone documents (~500 tokens) replace monolithic codebase scanning (~10,000+ tokens)
- **Research-quality validation**: Checks for survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and merge quality
- **Reproducible output**: Paper-appendix-quality data dictionaries and full provenance tracking

[[GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/xuxiguo/Research-Data-Orchestra)

### Research Analysis Orchestra
Handles the **downstream analysis pipeline**: hypothesis-driven sample construction, regression analysis, visualization, and publication-ready results generation.

**Agent Roster:**
- `@Strategist` — Discusses hypotheses and designs the analysis plan
- `@Conductor` — Manages pipeline phases with user approval gates
- **Subagents**: Builder (sample construction) · Executor (regressions/tables) · Vizmaker (publication figures) · Reviewer (code audit) · Debugger (error diagnosis) · Sentinel (validation) · Scribe (documentation) · Janitor (repo cleanup)

**Pipeline Phases:**
1. Build analysis sample → 2. Run regressions & tables → 3. Generate figures & robustness → 4. Document & clean up

**Key Innovations:**
- **Hypothesis-driven**: Every decision traces to pre-registered hypotheses with expected signs
- **Publication-ready**: Tables and figures formatted for JF/JFE/RFS submission standards
- **Flexible compute**: Supports personal computer and SLURM cluster environments

> These two orchestras form a complete end-to-end research automation system: **Research-Data-Orchestra** feeds clean, validated datasets into **Research-Analysis-Orchestra**, which produces publication-ready results. Both systems require VS Code Insiders with GitHub Copilot agent mode enabled.

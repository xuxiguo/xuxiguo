Grounded in cutting-edge technology and financial theory, my research agenda spans three core areas: **FinTech**, **Machine Learning**, and **Investment Management**. I develop explainable AI models to uncover hidden patterns in mutual funds, hedge funds, and financial analyst behavior. My work bridges the gap between traditional finance and modern machine learning, with a particular focus on how artificial intelligence can enhance investment decision-making and risk management.

As an educator, I teach blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and finance to both undergraduate and graduate students. I'm passionate about making complex financial concepts accessible through hands-on learning experiences. Beyond the classroom, I actively research the intersection of AI and finance, exploring how machine learning can decode the complexities of financial markets.

## Teaching

**Customized GPT for Teaching** — A suite of Socratic educational agents for finance, blockchain, and business courses, structured around a DESIGN → IMPLEMENT → EVALUATE framework. Instructors use an automated prompt builder to deploy discipline-specific GPTs; student interactions are assessed via [CognitoAI](https://cognitoai.net/), a six-dimension evaluation platform with anti-cheating detection and instructor analytics. [[Repository]](https://github.com/xuxiguo/Customized-GPT-for-Teaching) | [[Demo]](https://customizing-chatgpt-for--zw2wg4r.gamma.site/)

**Blockchain Demo Hub** — Curated interactive demonstrations covering [hash functions](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash), [digital signatures](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/keys), [proof-of-work mining](https://stefanhuber.github.io/proof-of-work/), and [Bitcoin transactions](https://coindemo.io/) for undergraduate and graduate instruction.


## AI-Powered Research Workflow

A two-stage multi-agent orchestration system for empirical finance research, built on GitHub Copilot's agent framework. Specialized agents collaborate through a conductor-delegate pattern to automate the full pipeline from raw data to publication-ready output.

**Research Data Orchestra** — Manages the upstream pipeline: source discovery, extraction, cleaning, validation, and documentation. A lightweight backbone document architecture (~500 tokens) replaces monolithic codebase scanning, enabling parallel agent execution with built-in checks for survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and merge quality. [[Repository]](https://github.com/xuxiguo/Research-Data-Orchestra)

**Research Analysis Orchestra** — Manages the downstream pipeline: hypothesis-driven sample construction, regression analysis, figure generation, and robustness checks. Every analytical decision traces to pre-registered hypotheses; outputs meet JF/JFE/RFS formatting standards. Supports both local and SLURM cluster environments. [[Repository]](https://github.com/xuxiguo/Research-Analysis-Orchestra)

> The two systems form an end-to-end research automation pipeline: **Research-Data-Orchestra** supplies validated datasets to **Research-Analysis-Orchestra**, which produces submission-ready results. Requires VS Code Insiders with GitHub Copilot agent mode.
